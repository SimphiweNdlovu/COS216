                                    <li> Description : Gunslinger is the fourth installment of the Call of Juarez series of western-inspired games.
                                         The frame story, told in cutscenes, begins in 1910, in Kansas, where Silas, a patron in the pub, brags about his adventures in the Wild West. 
                                         This old man claims he used to be a bounty hunter who took down many of the famous outlaws.
                                          Most of the game has the player re-enacting Silas's presumed past, while in the present the hero is narrating his own story off-screen.
                                           Silas is an unreliable narrator, however, and his own in-game audience will point at plot holes in his tall tales.</li>
